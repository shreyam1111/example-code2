<p style="color:White;text-align:center">The <b>peafowl</b>,is a wellknown bird that can be found in parts of Asia as well as the Congo Basin. Males of this species are called <b>peacocks</b> and are often characterized by their distinct green and blue tail feathers. Females, however, are referred to as <b>peahens</b>, and often have duller coloring and less intriguing plumage. Peafowl come in various species, such as the most popular species, the <i>Indian peafowl</i> which is also referred to as the Blue peafowl and is found in its namesake, India. The <i>Green peafowl</i>, on the other hand, can be found in parts of Southeast Asia. Peafowls that are native to the Congo Basin are known as the <i>Congo peafowl.</i></p>

<p style="color:White">The most striking and recognizable feature of male peacocks is their long,iridescent tail feathers. This is called the peacock's "train". Trains often become longer and more elaborate as time goes on until it reaches its maximum at five to six years. Now, one may wonder, "What is the reason for this bird's bright, eye-catching feathers?" "Why are female peafowls outshined by their male counterpart's appearance?"<br>Well,the peacock's feathers, like many other species', are used to attract a female mate. This occurence can be found in many other bird species, where the male's feathers are deliberately made to be brightly colored to attract a female. Female peafowl often prefer males with longer trains and a larger number of "eyes" (iredescent, blue spots). The peahen's feathers, on the other hand, have dull coloring in order to provide camoflauge from predators in order to be able to take care of eggs.</p>

<h3 style="font-size:200%;color:White">Color and Species Variations</h3>

<p style="color:White">As the name implies, Green peafowls do tend to have a different coloring than other peafowl species. Interestingly, hybrids between Indian peafowls and Green peafowls do exist, and are called <i>Spaldings</i>. <br> Along with this, there many variations of the Indian peafowl. One popular variation are <b>white peacocks</b>. Although albino peacocks technically exist, most white peafowls are actually known as <i>leucistic</i>, a condition in which pigment cells fail to migrate. </p>

<h4 style="font-size:200%;color:White">Cultural Importance</h4>
<p style="color:White">The Indian peafowl is actually quite significant to Indian culture. The peafowl is even India's national bird and is protected by the country. In Hindusim, the peafowl is sacred, with each of its train "eyes" symbolizing the eyes of the Gods. <br>The peafowl even makes an appearance in the bible, as one of the most precious items brought by King Solomon from Asia. <br> Peacocks were also part of the Sinhalese zodiac. In the zodiac they were represented as the third animal of the zodiac. They were seen as symbols of pride and vanity. Many people at the time believed that the animal deliberately consumed poisonous substances to become immune to them. In fact, it was believed that consuming these substances was what gave the animal their plumage vibrant and colorful. </p>

<h4 style="font-size:200%;color:White">Fun Facts</h4>
<p style="color:White"> *Peacocks were served as a delicacy in ancient Rome. <br> <br>*There are many, <i>many</i> color variations of the Indian peacock, including but not limited to: the silver pied peacock (white with colored spots), Buford bronze (brown, bronze coloring), charcoal (dark, black-gray coloring), and many more. <br> <br> *Peafowls are omnivores and aren't picky at all, they'll eat just about anything. This includes amphibians, insects, seeds, plants, and even small reptiles. Domesticated peafowls wille even eat cooked rice and (occasionally) cat food. <br> <br> *Peafowls of all species are believed to be polygamous. </p>

<h5 style="font-size:200%;color:White">Endangerment and Conservation</h5>
<p style="color:White">Out of the three species of peafowl, the Green peafowl is considered endangered. These birds are often hunted for their meat and iconic feathers. Many are taken away to be sold as pets. Farmers in China and Thailand consider the birds pests and poison peafowls that come on their land. Loss of habitat is also an issue for the species.<br> The animal's population has been dwindling rapidly. The Green Peafowl was categorised as an endangered species in 2008. The population of adult peafowls in this species is believed to be between 10,000 and 19,999. </p>

<h6 style="font-size:140%;color:White">What Can You Do?</h6>
